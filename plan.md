## Professional Timeline (None so far but...)

Dynamically create a timeline svg with the connection between dots.
set an y value of the rendered size of the text  or a div next to it and overlay it?
add anitmation to draw the path on Scroll
add animation to text on scroll

Maybe instead of an svg the timeline is a vertical binary string?
Depending on the size it could be a message? ASCII in binary? 

### If binary option

#### ASCII message
- "Hello, World!"

Need to create a util function which would convert.
